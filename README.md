# 2D-ChestSystem-Game
An implementation of a chest system using Unity 2D

### Design Patterns implemented
1. MVC Pattern
   - Used to create and maintain chests
2. State Design Pattern
   - To manage different chest states
3. Observer Pattern
   - Primary communication between the UI and other services
4. Object Pool Pattern
   - Spawning and destroying the chests is minimized by using chest object pools

I've also implemented chest scriptable objects so that the inherent chest values can be easily modified.
